The following code runs an experiment I desgined in order to gauge bias in ChatGPT and Google Bard. The first set of the experiment, in the main file, runs Jonathan Haidt's popular Moral Foundations Questionaire on both programs many times over, varying temperature and asking ChatGPT and Bard to respond as member's of various groups. The data this generates is stored in CSV files for comparison to actual data from members of these groups.
