The following code runs an experiment I desgined in order to gauge bias in ChatGPT and Google Bard. 
The first set of the experiment, in the main file, runs Jonathan Haidt's popular Moral Foundations
Questionaire on both programs many times over, varying temperature and asking ChatGPT and Bard to 
respond as member's of various groups. The data this generates is stored in CSV files for comparison 
to actual data from members of these groups.

In the second part of this experiment, I'll ask ChatGPT and Bard to appraise a series of moral vignettes
in order to compare with Scott Clifford's 2011 Moral Vignettes Study.
